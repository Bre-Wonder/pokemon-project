# Pokemon Application

### Project Description: 
To create an application that pulled data from an external API of Pokémon data using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The application is meant to have interactive buttons on the UI to allow the user to reaveal more information about each Pokémon.

### Technologies Used: 
HTML | CSS | Javascript | jQuery | Bootstrap

### How to start up this project?


### API Used:
Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150)

### Learning Moments: 
(1) Learned how to write functions in Javascript (2) Parameters (3) Loop/forEach functions (4) if/else (5) asynchronous code (6) promises (7) jQuery (8) Bootstrap (9) DOM manipulation (10) Creating dynamic elements in js (11) Arrays, strings, objects

### What would I do differently? 
I would have made the search bar usable on the interface. I would have also changed the way the interface navigation bar looks when it drops down. 

### What was the biggest learning take aways? 
I struggled the most with choosing how to call a functio within another function. Parameters also served difficult to know when they could pull in other data. Adding each functions helped me to know how to get used to knowing where I needed to call certain functions.
